Trends in survival following dementia diagnosis

Understanding the survival of people living with dementia across time and healthcare systems can help policymakers assess the real-world impact of dementia on health and social care systems. The NeuroGEN group conducted a multinational study examining trends in relative mortality risk following a dementia diagnosis using data from eight databases. A common analytical protocol was developed by the lead authors, then reviewed and iteratively refined by the broader research team. Collaborators and data custodians from each participating country executed the standardized SAS code locally, ensuring that individual-level data remained within each jurisdiction. This repository contains the original study protocol and SAS code shared with all collaborators.

NeuroGEN (Neurological and Mental Health Global Epidemiology Network) (https://www.neurogen.hku.hk/) is an international big data research consortium focused on neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The network includes academic partners from Australia, China, Finland, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Scotland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom, each with access to corresponding regional health databases. NeuroGEN aims to support multinational research and promote collaboration across regions in the fields of neurodegenerative disease and mental health.
